# Interview Questions to practice

* Given a sorted array, find three values in the array that sum to a given number.

  e.g. Given `[1,2,3,4,5]`, can you find three values that sum to 10? If so, what values are they? The solution must be better than `O(N^3)`.

* Depth-first/Breadth-first tree/graph exercises

* Given a random Wikipedia article, how do you find the shortest possible way to reach the LiveRamp article by clicking the links on the pages? What data structures do you need? What if you had an API that gives you the list of links in a Wikipedia article? Space/time complexities? What if you didn't care about time complexity, but wanted to lower space complexity?

* Find `K`th smallest number in array of size `N` with `O(N)` time complexity.

* How do I know if a path exists between a start and end node in a large unweighted and undirected graph?

* Given two strings, what is the minimum number of steps you must take to change it into another string of the same length? Each step consists of changing one letter and the resulting word must be in the English language.
