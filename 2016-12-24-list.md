# Interview Questions to practice

* Given a sorted array, find three values in the array that sum to a given number.

  e.g. Given `[1,2,3,4,5]`, can you find three values that sum to 10? If so, what values are they? The solution must be better than `O(N^3)`.

* Depth-first/Breadth-first tree/graph exercises

* Given a random Wikipedia article, how do you find the shortest possible way to reach the LiveRamp article by clicking the links on the pages? What data structures do you need? What if you had an API that gives you the list of links in a Wikipedia article? Space/time complexities? What if you didn't care about time complexity, but wanted to lower space complexity?

* Find `K`th smallest number in array of size `N` with `O(N)` time complexity.
